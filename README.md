# Word Switcheroo

This is a Chrome extension I made as a small personal project because I wanted to learn writing in JavaScript and HTML. Plus, I wanted to make something I could prank people with.

This is Word Switcheroo, a Chrome extension that allows the user to change any word on the current web page they're browsing to another word of their choice.

# Execution

Using this extension is fairly straightforward. You simply press the kangeroo icon in the top right corner of your Chrome browser and a small interface will pop up (Extension.png). If you want to change a word on the web page you're currently on, you simply type the word you want changed into the 'Word to change:' text box. Then in the 'Word to change to:' text box, you place whatever word you want to change to. Then click the 'Change' button, and the web page will be edited (ExtensionExecuted.png).

# Download

If you wish to download this extension, you need to have the Google Chrome browser on your computer, since this extension can only run in Chrome. Once you've downloaded this extension, open up a Chrome window and put this link in the address bar.
> chrome://extensions

Then check the 'Developer mode' check box in the top right corner. A few buttons should pop up once you do this. Press the 'Load unpacked extension' button and find wherever you placed the WordSwitcheroo directory that you downloaded. Click the folder, then press OK. Now you have the extension on your Chrome browser. Make sure to uncheck the 'Developer mode' check box for safety reasons.
